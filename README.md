# ML-Identifying-the-dataset-contents-and-shape
Hey everyone, here we have for the contents and shape of the dataset, we have 1. Fisher Iris Dataset, 2. then K-Means, 3. Gaussian Mixture Models

Here we are uploading using pandas numpy, and matlpotlib on the dataset Iris dataset  
-> printing the iris data and 
-> printing the iris data set shape. 
-> it gives the number of rows and columns

-> Now Iris Labels 
-> same as above Iris labels and iris shape.

-> Now we needed to take only 2 features and the main thing is first 2 features.
-> now display Scatter plot
-> plot x label 
-> plot y label
-> Plot xlim 
-> plot ylim
->  

-> plot grid function.
-> plot legend 
-> plot show

from this you got your plot 

Now just to know more about the details of this dataset we will inquire about more things, like the count of species and how many elements are there.

Implementation of K-means clustering.
using the sklearn clustering, and getting the unique values from it.

now again plotting up the scattered plot, Plt title and plt legend for references

-> 2.3 
Gmm model
 applying gmm and making up the plot.

-> Component / gaussian scatter plot
- make a scatter plot and trying showing the outlier.

-> The method used to initialize the weights, the means and the precisions. Must be one of 'kmeans' or 'random', by default is kmeans. Trying below to improve the clustering after some standard scaling of data.

2.4
- Scaling the data
- Using kmeans Elbow method to identify the optimal k
- We see an elbow forming up at 6 , so let us try to cluster data with k = 6 using kmeans
- Let us plot the clusters to check the datapoints
-Applying GMM to 2.4
